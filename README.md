## üìå Introduction

ARM(Addressable Resources Management) is an extension utility for Unity's Addressables package.

It's a system that wraps the handle management elements, which are a drawback of the existing addressables, to automate management as much as possible.

It also simplifies resource loading, caching, and memory management to provide performance and convenience for game development.
